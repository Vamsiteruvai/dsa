A circular linked list is a data structure where the last node connects back to the first, forming a loop. This structure allows for continuous traversal without any interruptions. Circular linked lists are especially helpful for tasks like scheduling and managing playlists, this allowing for smooth navigation. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basics of circular linked lists, how to work with them, their advantages and disadvantages, and their applications.

What is a Circular Linked List?
A circular linked list is a special type of linked list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle. Unlike a regular linked list, which ends with a node pointing to NULL, the last node in a circular linked list points back to the first node. This means that you can keep traversing the list without ever reaching a NULL value.

Types of Circular Linked Lists
We can create a circular linked list from both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. So, circular linked list are basically of two types:

1. Circular Singly Linked List
In Circular Singly Linked List, each node has just one pointer called the “next” pointer. The next pointer of last node points back to the first node and this results in forming a circle. In this type of Linked list we can only move through the list in one direction.

2. Circular Doubly Linked List:
In circular doubly linked list, each node has two pointers prev and next, similar to doubly linked list. The prev pointer points to the previous node and the next points to the next node. Here, in addition to the last node storing the address of the first node, the first node will also store the address of the last node.

Note: In this article, we will use the circular singly linked list to explain the working of circular linked lists.
